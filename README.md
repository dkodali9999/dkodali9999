CLABSI Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the risk of Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) in patients using machine learning. CLABSI is a critical healthcare-associated infection, and early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

The notebook demonstrates a complete data science workflow including:

Data loading and exploration
Preprocessing and feature engineering
Model building and evaluation
Insights and interpretation of results

Technologies & Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and anomalies
Data preprocessing including missing value treatment and encoding
Binary classification modeling to predict CLABSI presence
Performance comparison across multiple models
Visualization of feature importances and ROC curves

How to Run

Clone the repository or download the notebook.
Make sure you have the required Python packages installed:
-pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Open the notebook in Jupyter and run all cells.

Results

The Random Forest model achieved the best balance between accuracy and interpretability.
Key predictors for CLABSI include central line days, ICU stay, and comorbidities.
